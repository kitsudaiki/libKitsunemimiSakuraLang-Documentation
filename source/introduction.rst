Introduction
============

Thi library `libKitsunemimiSakuraLang` provides a simple script-language. It is packed as library for easy used in different tools. Originally it was created exclutively for the SakuraTree project (https://github.com/kitsudaiki/SakuraTree), but in the end it become generic and flexible enough to be also interesting for other upcoming projects, so it was moved into its own library.

IMPORTANT: At the moment this documentation only contains the outsources syntax documentation of the Sakura-Project. There is still a usage-documentation fot he library missing in this documentation. Beside this the documentation is not totally up-to-date, but keep in mind, that I have only a very limited amound of free time available for my projects, so at the moment I have to use this time for more important tasks. Sorry. I will update the documentation, when I have some time left.
